## Error-metrics vs. Model size and Time taken vs. Model size

For the model size, the networks are implemented at a minimum of 4 different sizes and minimum size of each network must be at least 3 layers. I have named the networks: model1(3 layers), model2(4 layers), model3(5 layers), model4(6 layers), and model5(7 layers). The number of image is set to be 1500 to trains all 5 models.

network.py and data.py files are writen separately and are called in main.py
